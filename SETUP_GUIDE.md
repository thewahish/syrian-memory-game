## Step 2: Upload Files to GitHub

### Method A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easier)

1. In your new repository, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Create the folder structure by uploading files to these paths:

**Upload these files in order:**

4. **Create assets folders:**
   ```

   (The `.gitkeep` files ensure empty folders are tracked)

### Method B: Using Git Commands (Advanced)

# Create placeholder files for empty folders
touch assets/audio/music/.gitkeep

git add .
git commit -m "Initial game setup"
git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

   ```javascript
   const uniqueAudioFilenames = [
       'your-actual-song-1.mp3',
       'your-actual-song-2.mp3',
       'syrian-anthem.mp3',
       // etc...
   ];
   ```

### For Sound Effects:

2. Upload these files (create simple sounds or find royalty-free ones):
   - `flip.mp3` - Card flip sound
   - `match.mp3` - Success sound
   - `no-match.mp3` - Error sound  
   - `win.mp3` - Victory sound
   - `lose.mp3` - Game over sound

## Step 5: Test Your Game

2. Test all features:
   - Card flipping and matching
   - Timer and scoring
   - Difficulty selection
   - Music player controls
   - Sound effects
   - Mobile responsiveness

## Step 6: Customize (Optional)

### Change Colors:
Edit `css/style.css` and modify the CSS variables:
```css
:root {
    --color-forest: #YOUR-COLOR;
    --color-golden-wheat: #YOUR-COLOR;
    /* etc... */
}
```

### Add More Facts:
Edit `js/script.js` and add to the `syrianRevolutionFacts` array.

### Change Card Symbols:
Edit the `cardValues` arrays in `GRID_CONFIGS` in `js/script.js`.

## Troubleshooting

### Game doesn't load:
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Ensure all file paths are correct
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled

### Audio doesn't play:
- Check if audio files exist in correct folders
- Verify filenames match the array in `script.js`
- Some browsers block autoplay - user must interact first

### Styles look wrong:
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
- Check if `css/style.css` was uploaded correctly

### Mobile issues:
- Ensure viewport meta tag is in `index.html`
- Test in landscape orientation

## Need Help?

1. **GitHub Pages Status**: Check repository Settings â†’ Pages for deployment status
2. **Browser Console**: Press F12 to see error messages
3. **File Paths**: Ensure all files are in correct folders as shown in README
4. **Case Sensitivity**: GitHub is case-sensitive with filenames

## Quick File Checklist

After setup, your repository should look like this:

```
âœ… index.html
âœ… README.md
âœ… css/style.css
âœ… js/script.js
âœ… assets/audio/music/ (with your .mp3 files)
âœ… assets/audio/sfx/ (with sound effect files)
âœ… assets/images/ (for future use)
```

**Once everything is uploaded and GitHub Pages is enabled, your game will be live!** ðŸŽ‰
